### Executive summary
We work on the [Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) Dataset  
from Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H.  
This dataset is available under CC BY-SA licence.  

We will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

Sorry for Project length, with Code output only, it still goes up to 3979 words.
